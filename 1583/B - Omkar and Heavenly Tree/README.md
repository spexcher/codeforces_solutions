## Problem Statement

<div class="header"><div class="title">B. Omkar and Heavenly Tree</div><div class="time-limit"><div class="property-title">time limit per test</div>2 seconds</div><div class="memory-limit"><div class="property-title">memory limit per test</div>256 megabytes</div><div class="input-file input-standard"><div class="property-title">input</div>standard input</div><div class="output-file output-standard"><div class="property-title">output</div>standard output</div></div><div><p>Lord Omkar would like to have a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes ($$$3 \le n \le 10^5$$$) and has asked his disciples to construct the tree. However, Lord Omkar has created $$$m$$$ ($$$\mathbf{1 \le m  \lt  n}$$$) restrictions to ensure that the tree will be as heavenly as possible. </p><p>A tree with $$$n$$$ nodes is an connected undirected graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$n-1$$$ edges. Note that for any two nodes, there is exactly one simple path between them, where a simple path is a path between two nodes that does not contain any node more than once.</p><p>Here is an example of a tree: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/0c2c664b43f98f7f388ef52d12fba06d30758778.png" style="zoom: 50.0%;max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>A restriction consists of $$$3$$$ pairwise distinct integers, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le a,b,c \le n$$$). It signifies that node $$$b$$$ cannot lie on the simple path between node $$$a$$$ and node $$$c$$$. </p><p>Can you help Lord Omkar and become his most trusted disciple? You will need to find heavenly trees for multiple sets of restrictions. It can be shown that a heavenly tree will always exist for any set of restrictions under the given constraints.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$\mathbf{1 \leq m  \lt  n}$$$), representing the size of the tree and the number of restrictions.</p><p>The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i, c_i \le n$$$, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">$$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ are distinct</span>), signifying that node $$$b_i$$$ cannot lie on the simple path between nodes $$$a_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases will not exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, output $$$n-1$$$ lines representing the $$$n-1$$$ edges in the tree. On each line, output two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$) signifying that there is an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Given edges have to form a tree that satisfies Omkar's restrictions.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id008835681809964476" id="id0019969281910717096" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id008835681809964476">2
