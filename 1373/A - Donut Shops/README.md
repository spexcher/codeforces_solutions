So if you want to buy $$$x$$$ donuts from this shop, then you have to buy the smallest number of boxes such that the total number of donuts in them is greater or equal to $$$x$$$.</p><p>You want to determine two <span class="tex-font-style-bf">positive integer</span> values: </p><ol> <li> how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the first shop than in the second shop? </li><li> how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the second shop than in the first shop? </li></ol><p>If any of these values doesn't exist then that value should be equal to $$$-1$$$. If there are multiple possible answers, then print any of them.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The printed values should be less or equal to $$$10^9$$$.

For example, for $$$3$$$ or $$$5$$$ donuts you'll have to buy a box of $$$10$$$ donuts for $$$4$$$ dollars. $$$3$$$ or $$$5$$$ donuts in the first shop would cost you $$$15$$$ or $$$25$$$ dollars, respectively, however. For $$$20$$$ donuts you'll have to buy two boxes for $$$8$$$ dollars total. Note that $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ are also valid answers for the second shop, along with many other answers.</p><p>In the second testcase buying any number of donuts will be either cheaper in the first shop or the same price. $$$8$$$ donuts cost $$$32$$$ dollars in the first shop and $$$40$$$ dollars in the second shop (because you have to buy two boxes). $$$10$$$ donuts will cost $$$40$$$ dollars in both shops, so $$$10$$$ is not a valid answer for any of the shops.</p><p>In the third testcase $$$1$$$ donut costs $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ dollars, respectively. $$$2$$$ donuts cost $$$4$$$ and $$$3$$$ dollars. Thus, $$$1$$$ is a valid answer for the first shop and $$$2$$$ is a valid answer for the second shop.</p><p>In the fourth testcase $$$10^9$$$ donuts cost $$$10^{18}$$$ dollars in the first shop and $$$10^9$$$ dollars in the second shop.</p></div>
