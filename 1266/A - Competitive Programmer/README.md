He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked $$$n$$$ of them how much effort they needed to reach red.</p><p>"Oh, I just spent $$$x_i$$$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">hours</span> solving problems", said the $$$i$$$-th of them. </p><p>Bob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">minutes</span> ($$$60 \cdot x_i$$$), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes — for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent $$$2$$$ hours, Bob could write $$$000120$$$ instead of $$$120$$$.</p><p>Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently: </p><ul> <li> rearranged its digits, or </li><li> wrote a random number. </li></ul><p>This way, Alice generated $$$n$$$ numbers, denoted $$$y_1$$$, ..., $$$y_n$$$.</p><p>For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $$$y_i$$$ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $$$60$$$ (possibly with leading zeroes).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 418$$$) — the number of grandmasters Bob asked.</p><p>Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains a single integer $$$y_i$$$ — the number that Alice wrote down.</p><p>Each of these numbers has between $$$2$$$ and $$$100$$$ digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>Output $$$n$$$ lines.</p><p>For each $$$i$$$, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of $$$y_i$$$ such that the resulting number is divisible by $$$60$$$, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">red</span>" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">cyan</span>".</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id009222867785109906" id="id0034395792619758625" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id009222867785109906">6
